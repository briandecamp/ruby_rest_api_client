ruby_rest_api_client
====================

A sample Ruby client for communicating with the UltraDNS REST API

Dependencies
============

This sample code depends on the faraday library, which can be found at: https://github.com/lostisland/faraday

You can add faraday to your environment with:

gem install faraday


Functionality
=============

The sample code does not attempt to implement a client for all available UltraDNS REST API functionality.  It provides access to basic functionality.  Adding additional functionality should be relatively straightforward, and any contributions from the UltraDNS community would be greatly appreciated.  See sample.rb for an example of how to use this library in your own code.

Questions
=========

Please contact UltraDNS support if you have any questions or encounter any issues with this code.
